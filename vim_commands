============ indent =============
Use :set cindent (:set cin for short) or :set smartindent (:set si for short). If your line ends in an opening brace, and you hit Enter, the following line will automatically be indented one additional level. (This is better than :set autoindent, which merely indents the next line at the same level.) cindent is better tailored to C-like languages, while smartindent is more versatile for use with other programming languages.
